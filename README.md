**PhishingScan** is a secure, open-source REST API built with Java Spring Boot to detect phishing URLs using a Hugging Face AI model ([`mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-urlphishing`](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-urlphishing)). It features JWT-based authentication, SQLite for lightweight persistence, and role-based access control with Spring Security. The API is designed for easy integration, robust security, and extensibility.

## Features

- üîê **Secure Authentication**: User registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
- üß™ **Phishing Detection**: Classifies URLs as `phishing` or `benign` using a Hugging Face BERT model.
- üîí **Role-Based Authorization**: Protects sensitive endpoints with Spring Security.
- üíæ **Lightweight Persistence**: Stores user data in SQLite, with plans for scan history tracking.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer-Friendly**: Built for easy testing with Postman or cURL.

## AI Model

The project uses the [**`mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-urlphishing`**](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-urlphishing) model from Hugging Face. This BERT-based model is fine-tuned to classify URLs as `phishing` or `benign` with high accuracy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: 17 or higher
- **Maven**: 3.8+
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Recommended for development
- **Hugging Face API Token**: Obtain a free token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **Postman**: Optional, for testing API endpoints
- **DB Browser for SQLite**: Optional, for inspecting the SQLite database

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammed28s/PhishingScan.git
   cd PhishingScan


Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install


Configure the Hugging Face API token:

Create a .env file in the project root or set the environment variable:export HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your-huggingface-token


Alternatively, update application.yml:huggingface:
  api-token: your-huggingface-token





Usage
Running the Application

Start the application:
mvn spring-boot:run

Or, build and run the JAR file:
mvn package
java -jar target/PhishingScan-1.0.0.jar


Access the API at http://localhost:8080.


Testing with Postman or cURL

Register a User:

Endpoint: POST /api/auth/register
Body:{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}


Example with cURL:curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"123456"}'




Login:

Endpoint: POST /api/auth/login
Body:{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}


Response:{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOi..."
}


Example with cURL:curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"123456"}'




Scan a URL:

Endpoint: POST /api/phishing/check
Header: Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
Body (form-urlencoded): url=https://suspicious-url.com
Response:{
  "url": "https://suspicious-url.com",
  "classification": "phishing"
}


Example with cURL:curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/phishing/check -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "url=https://suspicious-url.com"





API Endpoints



Method
Endpoint
Description
Authentication Required



POST
/api/auth/register
Register a new user
None


POST
/api/auth/login
Login and receive a JWT token
None


POST
/api/phishing/check
Analyze a URL for phishing
JWT (Bearer Token)


Database
The project uses SQLite for lightweight persistence, managed via Spring Data JPA. The database includes:

User Table: Stores user credentials (email, hashed password).
ScanHistory Table: Planned for future implementation to track per-user scan results.

You can inspect the database using DB Browser for SQLite.
Configuration
The application is configured via application.yml. Key settings include:

Database: SQLite (stored locally as phishing_scan.db)
Hugging Face API: Token and endpoint for the BERT model
JWT: Secret key and token expiration
Server: Default port is 8080

Example application.yml:
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:sqlite:phishing_scan.db
    driver-class-name: org.sqlite.JDBC
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
server:
  port: 8080
huggingface:
  api-token: ${HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN}
  url: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-urlphishing
jwt:
  secret: your-jwt-secret
  expiration: 86400000

To use a different database (e.g., MySQL), update the spring.datasource properties.
Future Improvements

Scan History: Track and store scan results per user in the ScanHistory table.
Admin Dashboard: Build a web interface for scan analytics and user management.
Docker Support: Containerize the application for easier deployment.
Swagger Documentation: Add Springdoc OpenAPI for interactive API documentation.
